FROM - To copy an Image present in Docker Hub
    "FROM gcc:4.9"

ENV - To set environment variables in docker contaier
    "MONGO_DB_USER_NAME=admin"

RUN - Run any Linux Command before container start to do all sorts of preprocessing via commands required for container to run
    RUN g++ main.cpp -o myapp

COPY - Copy setup files inside image from host while building it. COPY takes in a src and destination. It only lets you copy
    in a local file or directory from your host (the machine building the Docker image) into the Docker image itself.
    COPY . /app

Add - COPY and ADD are both Dockerfile instructions that serve similar purposes. They let you copy files from a specific location 
    into a Docker image. ADD lets you supports 2 other sources. First, you can use a URL instead of a local file / directory.
    Secondly, you can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination.

CMD - CMD is an entry point commands unlike RUN CMD is used only once. So using this command means telling docker file that run 
    this command as an entrypoint to trigger container operation.
    CMD ["./myapp"]
