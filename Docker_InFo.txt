Docker Concepts : 

Pain points that docker solves :
- No need to maintain dependencies on every machine.
- No need to manage software version dependencied for all instances.
- Same setup configuration can be easily maintained across all instances

So if docker setup runs on developer environment then it will for sure run the setup on all other test and 
production environment

- So no need to do a tedious installation procedure on all the instances
- Multiple versions of same software can run on single machine on different nodes parallely.
- Once work is completed on a specific container we can remove entire development environment in one go without 
	individually removing every dependency. We can just drop the node or container.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Container : 
- Container is a active instance of docker image.
- A container is an isolated environment to run an application.
- Techinically Container is just a process like other process.
- Its differnt than a vm which used entire copy of operation system and resource intensive where as container do the
	same task but instead of flashing a new operating system it used existing host OS to do task hence its light weight.
- As it used host OS ity can start quickly and do not need a lot hardware resources.
- Due to this we can run a lot containers parallely than compare to VM on same machine.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker Architecture  :

- It has a Client server architecture. And communication between client and server is carried out by REST APIs.
- Server is also called "Docker Engine", which sits in background an takes care of building and running 
	docker Containers.
- All Container on the host shares same Kernel of the Operating system of the Host.
- Hence for example we can run linux container on only on linux machin beacause linux container need linux kernel
	to execute the container. However we can use Linux as well as windows container on windows as windows can be 
	shipped with linux kernel(WSL). In case of MAC it dose not support containerised application. Hence docker on MAC 
	uses a light weight linux VM to run linux container.

Docker Work Flow

Step 1 : Dockerize the Intented Application 
	- In this step we make a small change in application so that it can be run by docker.
	- we Add a dockerfile to it. A dockerfile is plain text file which contains a instruction read by docker so that it
		can package it to be run on docker. This Image contains everything that application need to run.
	- The content of package may be 
		1. A cut down OS
		2. A runtime environment (a node)
		3. Application files
		4. Third - Party libs 
		5. Environment Variables
		Hence a docker file is needed to have every dependecy information in it so that docker can package that
		application into image. And once a image is ready we can tell docker to start a container using that image.
	- Once an image is propely working the we can push that image on Docker Hub to be pulled on another machines.
		Docker to Docker hub is similar like git to GitHub. It stores all ddevelopment images across all versions,
		to be pulled on and worked on later.
	- Once Dockerfile is added in setup you can build docker file command

		docker build -t <tag to indetify docker image> <location of the dockerfile>
		"docker build -t hello-docker ."
	
	- Once its built successfully we can not see image in setup or project folder docker stores it at different locations
		in multiple files as an image. 
	
	- To list all the docker images present in machine

		"docker image ls"

Step 2 : Run Docker Image
	- To run docker Image can simply run following command provided that image is present in the machine.

	"docker run <image name>"
	"docker run hello-docker"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker Multistage Build : 
	A multi-stage build is a process that allows you to break the steps in building a Docker image into multiple stages.
This will enable you to create images that include only the dependencies that are necessary for the desired functionality
of the final application, cutting down on both time and space.

			-----	Docker File -----

FROM alpine AS stage1
LABEL maintainer="Collabnix"
RUN echo "Welcome to Docker Labs!" > /opt/index.html

FROM nginx:alpine
LABEL maintainer="Collabnix"
COPY --from=stage1 /opt/index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

			----- End of Docker file -----

Docker Persistant - Docker persistance for data can be managed by below 4 methods.

Persistant Data : 
		- Is is data persisted by docker throughout application lifecycle, which will be present when application will
		stop and start again.
		- Example is customer records, application database and logs.

Non Persistant Data :
		- It is the type data which is removed or deleted upon container stop.

1. tmpfs :
	- tmpfs is the storage availble to container which uses memory present in the docker host which is also fast in memory 
		storage.
	- Its not Persistant because its not being stored in disk, and can't be shared with other containers.
	- It should be used for storing sensetive data which is not supposed to be stored for long time or on disk.

2. Volumes :
	- Volume is memory which is independent of the start and stop of container. It is recomended due to following reason.
		1. Volume is independent of container life cycle.
		2. They can mapped to external storage.
		3. Multiple container can share single volume.
	- The Volume storage is managed by the docker and created on the fly as needed   

	Generally way to use use a volue is simple. Create a volume and map that that volume to the container.

3. Bind Mount : 
	- Bind mount allows you to take a folder inside a hosts file system and mount a storage in that folder.
	- That mounted foler can be shared among multiple container hence very helpful for sharing data among container.
	- It also introduces some drawbacks 
		1. container using Bind mount can be highly dependent on the data on the mounted location.
		2. If data is or location of the bind mount is changed the container might not work properly
		3. If same folder structure is not present on other host then container may not work properly.

4. Named Pipes :

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker Network

Default Network : 
- After Installing docker, docker will hae its own ip address similar to host machine which it gets via router directly.
- Whenever a container is created, docker creates a virtual ethernet interface which connects docker and container via 
	virtual ethernet. Docker acts like a virtual switch which can connects multiple container to network similar to router
	and PCs. Which means docker is also runnign DHCP. This is how docker containers can communicate to each other via vietual
	docker network.
- Port forwarding is disabled by default so access running website in a contaier we need to forwars the port of container to
	external world.
- the usage of default network should be avoided, instead user network or other networks can be used.


User Created network : 
- User created network is similar to the default network except its created by the user.


Host Network 
- when you deply a container in host network, which menas your container will be running in yous systems host network.
- other container may use default network or user network property, but container ran is host will always share hosts 
	network property.
- means no need t expose any ports, meaning if any server runnig on this container can be directly accessed
- Its just runs like a application on your host operating system.


MAC VLAN Nwtwork : 
- Mac vlan removes all the complications in previous types and directly connects the container to physical router present
	in the network.
- due to this container gets its own mac address similar to a personal computer in your network.
- if you are trying to connect up in netwoking hirarchy it may not work as your container have mac address and 
	your mac address and yous hosts mac address is getting reported by the same physical ethernet connetction to 
	your router to a single port. So that port can not differentiate between those two mca ids coming from same 
	wired connection. To overcome this promiscious mode is required.
Promiscious mode <extra info> 
- Another problem with mac vlan is that while creating macvlan bridge you need to mention ip address too. Your routers
	DHCP wont assign an it to it, instead docker dhcp will assign ip yo your container which can create problem

	It has two modes 1. mac vlan bridge mode - connect directly to the host network
					 2. mac vlan (802.1q) mode - makes docker create a seperate network with only single container


IP VLAN Network L2: 
- Similar to vlan each container has its own ip address but unline to MAC vlan network, instead of having seperate 
	mac id contianer will have same mac id as of host.
- this solves the Promiscious mode problem and helps container communicate up in hirarchy.
- so on a sinlge routr port multiple ips will ne rported but mac address will be one.


IP VLAN Network L3:
- Connects to the host like router. It convets yous host into a router.
- No broadcast information
- No way to connect to outer network because no entry for container network exists in routing table.
- which menas container is not conneted to internet. it gives more control over network container.
- its like hosting two different network incapable to talking to each other beacause no routing is known.
- to make the routing way known and talk to outer network we can add entry in routing tables. and then 
	contianer can access internet.


Overlay network : 
- if you have multiple hosts in the network all of which are running their own docker container, so 
	if they need to communincate over differnt hosts overlay network is used.
- Docker sworm <extra info>

The none network : 
- No netwok already present in the docker. May not be able to connect to it via network <more info>
